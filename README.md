# Home Automation and Agricultural Monitoring System
This project focuses on designing a low-cost, energy-efficient, and adaptable system for home automation and agricultural monitoring using Zigbee technology. The system leverages Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) to monitor and control environmental parameters and home devices such as lights, fans, doors, and surveillance systems.
